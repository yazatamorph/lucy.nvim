# lucy.nvim

Because I wanted it, a color scheme for neovim based on Gleam's [official branding](https://gleam.run/branding/) with inspiration and additional colors from [trag1c/gleam-theme](https://github.com/trag1c/gleam-theme). My deepest gratitude to the authors of [rose-pine/neovim](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim): the vast bulk of the code is theirs; I've just plugged in some hex values and changed names.

The theme is named after Gleam's mascot, Lucy the Starfish:
